Reputation Scoring System with AI & Soulbound NFTs
🏆 Project Overview
This project introduces a decentralized reputation scoring system on the Algorand blockchain, leveraging AI and Soulbound NFTs (non-transferable tokens). The system evaluates user credibility based on blockchain interactions, creating trust scores that cannot be transferred or manipulated.

🚀 Key Features
AI-powered Reputation Scoring: Uses machine learning to analyze transactions and determine a trust score.
Soulbound NFTs: Assigns non-transferable NFTs as reputation certificates.
Secure & Transparent: All reputation scores are recorded on the Algorand blockchain.
DApp Integration: Developers can integrate this reputation system into their applications.
Smart Contract Automation: Enforces reputation-based access control and incentives.
🎯 Use Cases
DeFi Lending Platforms: Lenders can evaluate borrowers’ credibility.
DAO Governance: Weighted voting based on reputation scores.
Web3 Marketplaces: Trust-based filtering for sellers and buyers.
Freelance & Gig Economy: Employers can assess freelancer credibility.
🛠 Tech Stack
Blockchain: Algorand
Smart Contracts: PyTeal, Reach
AI/ML: Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
Frontend: React.js, AlgoSigner
Backend: FastAPI, Firebase
Storage: IPFS, Algorand Indexer
🔗 ARC Proposal
This project introduces a new Algorand Request for Comments (ARC) standard for on-chain reputation scoring. The ARC defines:

Reputation Scoring Algorithm
Soulbound NFT Issuance & Revocation
Smart Contract Logic for Reputation-Based Access Control
Interoperability Guidelines for DApps
📌 How It Works
User Transactions Analysis: AI models assess past transactions and assign a Reputation Score.
Soulbound NFT Minting: If a user meets certain criteria, they receive a non-transferable NFT as proof of credibility.
Smart Contract Enforcement: DApps can use these scores for decision-making (e.g., loan approvals, governance rights).
Continuous Updates: Scores dynamically adjust based on new interactions.
🏗 Roadmap
 Design AI-based reputation model
